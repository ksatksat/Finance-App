@*
    This is a simple Razor Privacy view. It sets the page title, renders 
    a small privacy summary using Bootstrap classes, includes a mailto: 
    contact link, and prints a “Last updated” date. Everything that 
    starts with @ or sits inside @{ ... } runs on the server when the page is rendered.

Line-by-line (concise)
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Privacy";
}


A Razor code block executed on the server.

Stores "Privacy" into ViewData["Title"]. Commonly the layout reads 
this to set the HTML <title> tag and/or a page heading.

<div class="container py-4">
    <h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>


container py-4 are Bootstrap utility classes (responsive container and vertical padding).

@ViewData["Title"] is rendered as HTML (e.g., <h1>Privacy</h1>).

<p>Quick summary — only the essentials:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What we collect:</strong> Expense entries you add (description, amount, category, date).</li>
    <li><strong>Why:</strong> To show and summarize your expenses in the app.</li>

Static HTML content describing the app’s privacy practices.

<p>If you want your data deleted or have privacy questions, email 
    <a href="mailto:xatma123@gmail.com?subject=FinanceApp%20Privacy%20Question">xatma123@gmail.com</a>.</p>


Hard-coded mailto: link that opens the user’s mail client and pre-fills 
the subject (spaces URL-encoded as %20).

<p class="text-muted small">Last updated: @DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd")</p>
</div>


@DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd") is evaluated on the server at 
render time and inserted as a formatted UTC date (YYYY-MM-DD).

Note: this value is static once rendered — the page will not 
update it in the browser later.

Server vs client

All @ expressions run on the server; the browser receives plain HTML.

There is no client-side logic here (no JavaScript) — rendering 
and formatting happen before the response is sent.

Small gotchas and important notes

Hard-coded contact email: editing the view is required to change 
it. Better to store contact information in configuration or a 
view model for easier maintenance.

Date/time: you use UtcNow. That’s reasonable for consistent 
server-side timestamps, but if you want the viewer’s local 
date/time consider either rendering the UTC timestamp and 
converting client-side with JavaScript, or use server local time with a clear label.

Localization: strings and date formats are not localized. 
For multi-language apps, use resources and IViewLocalizer / IStringLocalizer.

Privacy requirements: if you need to satisfy GDPR/CCPA or similar, 
the page content should include specific instructions (data subject 
request process, retention policy, legal basis, data processor 
identity, etc.). This snippet is a good short summary but not a compliance document.

Small improvements (recommended)

Move email to configuration (appsettings) and pass it to the 
view from the controller or a strongly-typed view model:

// Controller
public IActionResult Privacy()
{
    ViewData["SupportEmail"] = _configuration["Support:Email"];
    return View();
}


In Razor:

<a href="mailto:@ViewData["SupportEmail"]?subject=FinanceApp%20Privacy%20Question">@ViewData["SupportEmail"]</a>


Use a strongly-typed model if the page may change or include dynamic values:

public class PrivacyViewModel { public string SupportEmail { get; set; } = ""; public DateTime LastUpdatedUtc { get; set; } }


Pass the model from the controller and use @model in the view.

Client-side local time (optional): render the UTC ISO 
string and convert in JS so users see local time:

<span id="lastUpdated" data-utc="@DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("o")"></span>
<script>
  const el = document.getElementById('lastUpdated');
  const dt = new Date(el.dataset.utc);
  el.textContent = dt.toLocaleString(); // browser local formatting
</script>


Localization: replace hard-coded strings with resource 
lookups (@Localizer["WhatWeCollect"]).

Enhance privacy details if the application must be legally 
compliant (retention periods, deletion workflow, legal 
basis, data processor contact, etc.).
